What was the goal and what were the requirements? How does this work meet them?

The goal was to mock up a sample site or "microsite" that focused on some kind of legislative, education, or awareness campaign/ push. In my current position, I'm using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Liquid to update our website (https://www.afscme.org/) using code snippets. Occassionally, we have one-off campaigns or projects that have a different feel or objective than our main site, for example: https://vaccine.afscme.org/ or https://rescue.afscme.org/child-tax-credit-calculator). This was a sample I came up with. 

Who did you work on this with, and which parts were you responsible for? (If there is no commit or ticket history to review, please be very explicit here)

I worked on this site by myself. I was responsible for the design and execution of the site. 

Please describe your experience working with open source frameworks. Which is your favorite and why?

I would say I feel comfortable working with open source frameworks but I don't have a lot of professional experience using them. I like using jQuery because I think it's easy to implement (great documentation) and a lot of the libraries are multifunctional. For example, the easing functions used in this project can be used in so many different ways, all with very different effects. https://api.jqueryui.com/easings/ 

A Senior Front-End Developer at ThinkShout is responsible for providing ticket specifications for other developers and performing code reviews. Describe your experience with giving peer feedback and writing specs.

I have experience giving peer feedback in educational and learning settings. I have not written specs for a website before except for my own personal projects. 

ThinkShout is committed to becoming an anti-racist organization. We recognize that everyone has different lived and professional experiences with racial, political, and/or environmental justice. Please share your thoughts on how racial equity, diversity and inclusion contribute to an organizationâ€™s success and how you would advance this in your role on the development team.

In tech, this point has been made numerous times but I think it bears repeating: a person's lived experiences and personal biases will be passed into the code they're writing, whether that's for artifiical intelligence, algorithms that will determine if someone can get a bank loan, or coding sites with the best accessibility practices (semantic sections, picture descriptions, etc.). Not checking for blindspots and allowing unrecognized biases into code isn't always malicious, but it will almost always have a significant consequence. In this way, it's important for organizations to be aware of their own blidnspots and take steps to remedy the issue. The more diverse and inclusive an organization can be, the more fulfilled and productive its employees will feel. This might also include characteristics outside of what's most frequently considered in the DEI space (race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.), such as allowing for variance and diversity in things as simple as communication styles or ways that opportunities/ problems are presented to different people.
