1. An interactive "activism" site based on a social justice, cultural, or societal issue

Examples: 
https://stopthestigma.info/
https://jigsaw.google.com/

https://www.ceros.com/inspire/project/covid-19-benchmark
https://cityplan.edmonton.ca/ (bonus)

I think about these sites as transforming data or infographics into a web experience. They are usually around one topic or cause per site and do a deep dive into that subject, making it more engaging and interesting by adding interactivity often in a full bleed format. Instead of traditional buttons, scrolling is normally the mechanism that moves you from "scene to scene" (scrolling as the EventListener?). I would try to use: 
    modal (at the beginning)
    animation (fading in or out, coming from the sides, elements growing or shrinking)
    focus
    css manipulations
    dynamically creating elements w/ JS
    etc.

2. Portfolio Site

Examples: 
https://fabianirsara.com/
https://meesverberne.com/
https://bepatrickdavid.com/ 
https://timroussilhe.com/ (bonus)

Build a skeleton that I could fill in later with other projects to showcase my work. It would include: 
    modal (for contact)
    hamburger menu
    a few animated elements
    dynamically creating elements w/ JS
    etc.
